# PC_SpinkLock

These algorithms are implementations of locks from literature.
The implementations can be found easyly on web.

To run the experiments, try *./run.sh* on terminal linux.
As the results, a graffic will be generated on the main directory within times of each algorithm.
You can set up the parameters in the begin of main code.
The parameters are statics variables.
You can set parameters like matrix dimension, number of tests, number of threads, etc.
If matriz size can be set to zero. This means the critic section will has nothing to execute.
