# PC_SpinkLock

These algorithms are implementations of locks from the literature. Implementations can be found easily on the web.

To run the experiments, try *./run.sh* in the linux terminal. As a result, a graph will be generated in the main directory within the times of each algorithm. <br>
You can configure the parameters at the beginning of the main class. The parameters are static variables. You can set parameters like array dimension, number of tests, number of threads, etc. <br>
The array size can be set to zero. This means that the critical section will have nothing to run.
